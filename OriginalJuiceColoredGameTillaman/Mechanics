HOW TO PLAY?
Juice Colored Game by Ryan Tillaman

Hello world to my game entitled Juice Colored Game.
This is game that will introduce you to color theory
It's all about color mixing, patience, and strategy.


What you need to know when starting the game?

1. You have 3 jars in the game filled with juices. (Red, Blue , and Yellow)
2. You need to drag and drop the specific jar to the glass of the customer in order to fill his order
3. A customer can have 1 to 3 orders depending on the level
4. If you made a mistake, you can drag the glass inside the trashcan located in the upper right corner of the screen and it'll 
	automatically reset the glass
5. Take note that when throwing a glass filled with juice will deduct your time and will deduct the quantity of your juices.
6. The game's duration is only 30 seconds, however if you correctly fill the customer's orders, the system will give you more time depending
	on the juice.
7. There will be a time when the quantity of your main jars will be out of stock. In this situation, you need to click
that specific jar and wait for it to reload. It can only load the jar with 3 juices.
8. The system will deduct you cash when reloading, so think twice if you really have to reload.
9. The customers have time in their head, when the customer's time run's out, they will exit the store and the system will deduct you time.
10. There are five levels, level 1 is already unlocked and you have 4 more levels needed to be unlocked
	> In order to unlock these levels, you need to earn a certain amount of money to buy that level.
	> You can play an unlocked level over and over again.

Strategy is the key, memorize the color combinations and be patient.

HAVE FUN!!!!!
